## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The cryptocurrency market is currently exhibiting a mixed picture. Bitcoin continues to dominate, showing resilience despite a slight pullback from its all-time high. Ethereum is showing signs of recovery but remains significantly below its previous peak. Whale activity indicates continued institutional interest, particularly in stablecoins and Ethereum.
