## 2. MARKET ANALYSIS

The global cryptocurrency market presents a complex picture, with varying trends across different assets.

*   **BTC Dominance:** Bitcoin's market cap percentage of 60.41% indicates its continued dominance, but also suggests that altcoins are capturing a significant portion of the market.
*   **Market Patterns:**
    *   **Accumulation:** Bitcoin, XRP, SOL, and ADA are showing signs of accumulation, as indicated by positive net flows on exchanges. This suggests investors are moving these coins off exchanges, potentially anticipating future price increases.

*   **Historical Context:** Bitcoin is currently trading approximately 22.36% below its all-time high of $108,786, reached in January 2025. Ethereum is trading a significant 66.93% below its all-time high of $4,878.26, reached in November 2021. This suggests that Bitcoin has recovered more strongly than Ethereum in recent months.
